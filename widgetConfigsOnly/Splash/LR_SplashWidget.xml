It provides relevant base maps and operational layers from several business systems so map-centric content can be visualized and used to assess the impact of property sales, foreclosures, and assessment appeals on real estate value and tax revenue.<BR /><BR />Sales, foreclosures and assessment appeals can be added to the map.  Information about each of these property transactions can be viewed by clicking on the Assessment Information tool. In addition, sales and foreclosures transactions can also be viewed over time. <BR /><BR />Year over year changes in assessed value can be visualized on a parcel by parcel basis by clicking on the Property Value tool. <BR /><BR />Sample data provided by Bloomfield Township, Michigan.</textformat>
