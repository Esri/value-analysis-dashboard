# value-analysis-dashboard

The Value Analysis Dashboard application provides a high-level view into changes in property assessments and tax revenue
in a local government. The Dashboard helps assessors, treasurers and other organizations in a local government analyze
the impact of sales, foreclosures and assessment appeals on year-over-year property values. The impacts can be analyzed
on a parcel by parcel basis or on a complete assessment neighborhood.
