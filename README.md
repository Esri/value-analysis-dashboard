# value-analysis-dashboard

***This value analysis dashboard repo functionality has been replaced by a configuration of the [Operations Dashboard](http://doc.arcgis.com/en/operations-dashboard/), applications built from this repo are in mature support.***

***Check out the new [Value Analysis Dashboard](http://links.esri.com/localgovernment/help/10.2/valueanalysisdashboard) solution***

The Value Analysis Dashboard application provides a high-level view into changes in property assessments and tax revenue
in a local government. The Dashboard helps assessors, treasurers and other organizations in a local government analyze
the impact of sales, foreclosures and assessment appeals on year-over-year property values. The impacts can be analyzed
on a parcel by parcel basis or on a complete assessment neighborhood.
