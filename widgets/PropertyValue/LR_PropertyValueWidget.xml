<!-- Field formatting for numbers
<field> terms may have an optional "format" attribute that specifies how they are to be displayed;
this only works for numeric fields.

If this format field contains a "$" symbol, it is formatted as currency; otherwise, it is formatted
as a number. If the field contains a "%" symbol, the value is multiplied by 100 before formatting
and a "%" symbol is appended to it.

If this format field contains a "," symbol, it is grouped into thousands using a comma.

If this format field contains a "." symbol, all of the characters from the period to the end
of the format field are treated as a precision number, i.e., the number of places to show after
the decimal point. If the format field ends with ".0", e.g., no decimal places or point are shown.
If the field ends with ".2", on the other hand, two decimal places are shown after a decimal point.
