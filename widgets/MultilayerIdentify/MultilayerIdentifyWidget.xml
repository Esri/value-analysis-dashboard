The <argis-viewer-note> sections are just so that a comment can be seen in the ArcGIS for Flex
Application Builder's configuration display referring the configurer to this file.

<identifytolerance> indicates the radius in pixels of the buffer to create around a click
point; without this, point features are nearly impossible to select.

<introduction>, <countdown>, <nofeatures>, and <attachmentsTitle> are text strings that
appear in the popup.

<validDomainList> is a comma-separated list of domains from which the widget may get
attachments. If the URL to an attachment is in this list, the attachment's caption is
a link to the attachment. Otherwise, the caption is simple text to avoid opening a
security hole. (Images are always retrieved, however.) The domain from which the widget's
app is run is always valid and does not need to be included in the parameter's list.

The <layers> section contains a <layer> tag for each layer to be identifiable. The <layer> tag
has the attributes "label" to match with the layer's label in the config.xml file and "type"
to match the layer's type (dynamic or feature).  Dynamic layers have <sublayer> subtags to
indicate which of its layers are identifiable; these <sublayer> tags have the attribute "id"
to indicate the sublayer's id number.

Within the <layer> tag for feature layers or the <sublayer> tag for the sublayers of a dynamic
layer, one can put the optional display tags <caption>, <format>, and <relationship>.

If the <caption> tag is supplied, its text is used as the title of the box displaying the
items found for the layer. If omitted, the layer's name is used.

If the <format> tag is supplied, its text is used as a format specification string for
displaying the attributes for each item found for the layer. If omitted, name-value pairs are
used for all attributes except the OBJECTID attribute. The contents of the format string are
described below.

If the <relationship> tag is supplied for a layer, related items (attachments and tables,
e.g.) are sought for the found features for that layer.  These related items are displayed
according to the <caption> and <format> tags that appear within the <relationship> tag.

The <format> tag contains a specification string encased within the "<![CDATA[" prefix and
"]]>" suffix.  Between these two 'fixes, one can place arbitrary text and some HTML tags
such as <b>, <u>, <br>, and <a>; see the documentation for ActionScript's TextConverter's
TEXT_FIELD_HTML_FORMAT constant for the full list
(http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/flashx/textLayout/conversion/TextConverter.html#TEXT_FIELD_HTML_FORMAT )

In addition to the arbitrary text and HTML tags, one can place fields for inserting
attribute names and values.  These fields are surrounded by braces ("{}") and begin with the
name of the attribute followed by a tilde ("~"). After the tilde, one places the keyword
"label", "value", "number", "currency", "phone", or "date".

The "label" and "value" keywords are complete: "label" will replace the whole brace field
with the name or alias of the attribute, e.g., "{NAME~label}" would be replaced with
"Station" in the format string if that were the alias for or name of the NAME attribute,
while "value" will replace the whole brace field with a Flex-specific string representation
of the value of the attribute.

The other keywords are followed by a additional specifications enclosed within parentheses
("()"):  "number" + specs will replace the whole brace field with the representation of a
number; "currency" + specs will replace the whole brace field with the representation of a
number preceded or followed by a currency symbol; "phone" + specs will replace the whole
brace field with the representation of a telephone number, including international
formatting; "date" + specs will replace the whole brace field with the representation of a
date and/or time. These additional specifications, which are separated from each other by
vertical bars ("|"), are converted to Flex Formatter options.

Numbers are formatted using the ActionScript NumberFormatter class
(http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/mx/formatters/NumberFormatter.html ),
and use five additional specifications: sign, thousands separator, decimal separator,
number of decimal places, and rounding. The specification for sign is "+" to not show a
sign even for a negative number, "-" to show a negative sign for a negative number, and
")" to use parentheses for a negative number. E.g., "{LONDD~number(+|,|.|3|nearest)}° W"
for a longitude value of -111.933333 will become "111.933° W". The thousands separator
is the character that separates groups of 1000; omit it for no separation. E.g., for an
attribute PRICE with a value of a million, "{PRICE~number(-||.|0|none)}" is converted to
"1000000" while "{PRICE~number(-|,|.|0|none)}" is converted to "1,000,000". The decimal
separator is the character that separates the whole and fractional parts of a number; it
must be different than the thousands separator. Rounding is specified using one of the
keywords "down", "nearest", "up", or "none".

Currencies are formatted using the ActionScript CurrencyFormatter class
(http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/mx/formatters/CurrencyFormatter.html ).
Their additional specifications are the same as for a number except that they add one
more specification field at the beginning to hold the currency symbol. If this symbol
is suffixed by a negative sign, the currency symbol is placed at the end of the number;
otherwise, it is placed at the beginning of the number. E.g., for an attribute PRICE
with a value of a million, "{PRICE~currency(€-|-|.|,|2|none)}" is converted to
"1.000.000,00€", while "{PRICE~currency($|-|,|.|2|none)}" is converted to
"$1,000,000.00". (Note that these examples also illustrate different thousands and
decimal separators.)

Phones are formatted using the ActionScript PhoneFormatter class
(http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/mx/formatters/PhoneFormatter.html ),
which permits characters from the set "+()#-. " to create the telephone number pattern.
E.g., the field "{PHONE~phone(+1-###-###-####)}" will show the full international
number for a US telephone number.

Dates are formatted using the ActionScript DateFormatter class
(http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/mx/formatters/DateFormatter.html#formatString ,
formatString property documentation), which uses uppercase letters to represent
parts of a date and time. Additional arbitrary lowercase text may be included in the
pattern; see the above link for the full description. An example format field is
"{SUBMITDT~date(M/D/YYYY K:NN A)}", which displays something like "7/7/1984 2:05 PM"
depending on the date and time.

Because braces are reserved for formatting, to include them, use their
escaped equivalents:  %7B for '{' and %7D for '}'.
